Detection of subtle bias using NLP transfer learning


This README.txt is part of the project to detect subtle bias language in Wikipedia articles using the Neutral Point of View (NPOV) dataset.

This project is being completed as part of the AI Insight Fellowship during the Spring of 2018.

The presentation overview for this project can be found here: https://bit.ly/2GwnrLi

  Data used in this project
  
      NPOV dataset
      Features data files
      Processed NPOV with features files
      WIKI2, WIKI103 links
  
  Language models created as a result of this work

  Source code
  
      //while you will need to get the entire fast.ai library to run the project, several files had to modified
      //only those modified files are included in this repo
      fast.ai libraries modified source code 
      
      seq2seq ibm modification
      
      OpenMNT Lua file with weights modifications
      
      scorer.py
      
      parser.py
      
  
  Jupyter notebooks
  
      Original fast.ai jupyter notebooks were used as a foundation and largely modified for the use of this project
      language-model.ipynb
      classification.ipynb
