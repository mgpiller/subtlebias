Detection of subtle bias using NLP transfer learning


This README.txt is part of the project to detect subtle bias language in Wikipedia articles using the Neutral Point of View (NPOV) dataset.

The presentation overview for this project can be found here: https://bit.ly/2GwnrLi


Data used in this project
  
      NPOV dataset
      Features data files
      Processed NPOV with features files
      WIKI2, WIKI103 data sets
  
Language models created as a result of this work
  
      WIKI2 Embeddings
      WIKI-103 Embeddings
 
Source code
  
      While you will need to get the entire fast.ai library to run the project, 
      several files had to modified in order to run the language models. 
      Only those modified files are included in this repo
      
      fast.ai libraries modified source code 
      
      seq2seq ibm modification
      
      OpenMNT Lua file with weights modifications
      
      scorer.py
      
      parser.py
      
  
  Jupyter notebooks
  
      Original fast.ai jupyter notebooks served as a foundation and were heavily modified for the use of this project
